## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS


### What I learned
This was a really challenging one. It took me 24 hours to complete this project. The completed site contains 3 different pages.  I had to learn on the go due to some tricky Javascript parts such as the dark mode toggle and the multi-step form. But  managed to pull it off. The site is fully responsive using SASS media query Mixins. I think the code can still be refactored further especially the Javascript code as i flaunted the DRY principle a lot especially with the dark mode toggle. I will be refactoring the code in the coming weeks.
